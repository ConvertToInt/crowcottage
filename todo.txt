footer issue - test on one page first (solution was to just make background white tbh) (on server: changed background color, div around 'section', footer remove mt-6, site path etc p-6, then i just made the whole site grey lol)
multiple calenders issue (both classes named the same smh)
calender response issue (fixed the way i search for the date model in classcontroller)
calender plus and minus (removed float:left, added has-text-centered to parent)

once finished, zip views in to server, replace app.scss in public folder(?)



zoom on hover?
clip photo to square (add thumbnail_1_id, thumbnail_2_id. 8 images uploaded (2 orig, 2 large, 2 med, 2 small))
images for classes (polymorphic? classes and products. otherwise have class_id and product_id in image table


validation of uploads (create product, class. contact us form)*****
change fillables
stripe publishable key
rough testing

~~~ faults
improper database design - one person can order twice, thus their address is duplicated in addresses table
    - check if address is complete match to prior entry. if so, use that address id in order table?
validate billing details solution
no checks to see if product is in basket - someone could add multiple of same product
cookie size small - only ~6 products can be added until max capacity. move to session data?
when address is being saved, if the shipping and billing is the same, only one address should be added

~~~ extra
blog page
virtual walkthrough
events page
make invoicing? pdf with reciept (https://github.com/sandervanhooft/laravel-invoicable)

switch email admin to 'crowcottagearts'
make admin email for client, .co.uk not .com
change smtp server to outlook?
change emails to reflect new domain (a new email from '..')
