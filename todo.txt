~~~ faults

improper database design - one person can order twice, thus their address is duplicated in addresses table
    - check if address is complete match to prior entry. if so, use that address id in order table?

total_price should be automatically updated when a item is added or removed, instead of being reset and calculated every time.
    - set as global variable? update global variable when things are added or removed.

validate billing details solution
