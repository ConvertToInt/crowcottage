rough testing

~~~ faults
improper database design - one person can order twice, thus their address is duplicated in addresses table
    - check if address is complete match to prior entry. if so, use that address id in order table?
validate billing details solution
no checks to see if product is in basket - someone could add multiple of same product
cookie size small - only ~6 products can be added until max capacity. move to session data?
when address is being saved, if the shipping and billing is the same, only one address should be added

footer issue - test on one page first (solution was to just make background white tbh) (on server: changed background color, div around 'section', footer remove mt-6, site path etc p-6, then i just made the whole site grey lol)
multiple calenders issue (both classes named the same smh)
calender response issue (fixed the way i search for the date model in classcontroller)
